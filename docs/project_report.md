## Project Summary
This project evaluates BER performance of BPSK and QPSK modulation schemes over
an AWGN channel using MATLAB simulation.

## Key Findings
- BPSK demonstrates superior noise robustness
- QPSK achieves higher data rate but is more sensitive to noise

## Engineering Insight
The project highlights a key trade-off in communication system design between
reliability and spectral efficiency.
